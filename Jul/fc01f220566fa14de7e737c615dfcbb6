 Nigerian banks received a combined deposit of N48.64 trillion from customers across various account types in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, which was 20.20 percent above N40.47 trillion collected in the comparable period of 2021. Analysis of the total deposits received from customers based on account type for the Nigerian lenders revealed that 47 percent, equivalent to N22.87 trillion, were paid into the current account. When disaggregated, customers deposited N10.38 trillion in term account, and N12.16 trillion in savings account across the banks listed on the Nigeria Exchange Limited (NGX). According to Gloria Fadipe, head of research at FCMB, deposits represent bank funds used in making money. She further noted that deposits have a direct relationship with bank loans, stating that “if deposits increase, loans increase”. Fadipe explained that based on account types, it is better for banks to have cheap deposits: current accounts, and savings accounts.
“Savings account attracts less than one percent and people don’t put their mind to it because they withdraw too many times, but current account attracts more. The higher the bank capital ratio, the lower the bank’s total funding cost and the more profitable the bank, and banks always try to ensure that the capital is growing. So, if the deposits that are growing are either in savings or current deposits, you can see the effect in the cost of funds which would be positive because it will reduce,” she added. Innocent Unah, executive director at Graham Lynch Capital said “positive growth in deposits can mean either the banks’ customers are growing in number, existing customers are depositing more money with the bank, the bank is generating deposit customers from its competitors, or more previously unbanked population are being banked now.”
Unah explained that the implication is that banks will be able to create more loans and support businesses and generate more earnings as a result of increased risk assets.
