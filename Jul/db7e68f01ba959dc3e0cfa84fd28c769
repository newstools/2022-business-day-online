 Rising from the ashes of lockdown, social distancing, and the faceless mask, The Ibejii Live Experience (TILX) is back. The double Headies nominee will be serenading fans with Afro-soul sound that speaks to love, life, societal ills, among others. Gonto, one of the songs to be performed at the live experience, is the first single by the renowned British/Nigerian afro-soul singer, composer, Ibejii, to receive a nomination for a 2022 Headies Award in the category of Best Alternative Song. It is an afro-orchestral song that transports the listener on a journey that encapsulates the callousness of the wealthy, as well as, the bravery of a new generation of believers. The second nomination, “Intermission” is in the category of Best Alternative Album. The six-track album is a collection of songs with themes about the issues faced by Nigerian youths, who have publicly protested in the last 18 months after being the target of police intimidation, harassment, and even torture.
