 Shinzo Abe, the former Prime Minister of Japan, is dead. Abe suffered a heart failure after being shot during a campaign speech Friday in western Japan, NHK public television said on Friday. NHK said that Abe was rushed to the hospital after he collapsed on the street, with him holding his chest with his shirt covered in blood. Footage being aired by the broadcast station showed his security guards running toward him to assist him in getting urgent medical attention. Abe was in Nara campaigning ahead of Sunday’s election for the parliament’s upper house and was giving a speech when people heard a gunshot. Police arrested a male suspect at the scene on suspicion of attempted murder, NHK said. Abe was taken to Nara Medical University Hospital for treatment, with national broadcaster NHK saying he was able to speak in the minutes after the attack but subsequently lost consciousness. He was pronounced dead by the hospital in the afternoon. “Shinzo Abe was transported to (the hospital) at 12:20 pm. He was in a state of cardiac arrest upon arrival. Resuscitation was administered. However, unfortunately, he died at 5:03 pm,” said Hidetada Fukushima, the hospital’s professor of emergency medicine.
