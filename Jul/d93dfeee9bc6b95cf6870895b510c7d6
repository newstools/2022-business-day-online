 The Nothing Company is a relatively new company that is owned by Carl Pay, the former chief of One Plus. A year ago, they came out with the Nothing Ear 1, wireless earbuds, which were launched in July 2021. The product stood out from other wireless earbuds because of its transparent stems, and now the company is back with its new smartphone that shows a transparent back. Design The Nothing Phone 1 is a solid mid-range Android phone. The phone comes with an aluminium frame with an IP53 water resistance rating, which means it can be saved from splashes. It is protected by Gorilla Glass 5, which protects the phone from the back to the front glass. It has a transparent rear with its Glyph interface, which can be set up to light up when certain conditions are met. It comes in only 2 colours, which are black and white.
