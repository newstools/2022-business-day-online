 Naira, Nigeria’s legal tender on Tuesday recorded an all-time depreciation against dollar at the official market known as the Investors and Exporters (I&E) forex window, as the shortage of foreign exchange persists. After trading on Tuesday, naira closed at N430 per dollar, lowest ever. This represents a one percent loss against N425.75/$ closed on the previous day at the I&E window, data from the FMDQ has revealed. Most foreign exchange market dealers who participated in the auction on Monday maintained bids at N413.40 (low) and N444 (high). At the parallel market, also known as the black market, the naira strengthened by N1.00 to close at N614 per dollar compared to N615 opened on Monday morning. Nigeria’s external reserves, which give the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) the muscle to defend the naira, have declined by 3.0 percent year to date to $39.25 billion as of July 4, 2022, from $40.5 billion recorded at the beginning of the year. Since the approval of the US$3.35 billion Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in August 2021 and the issuance of Eurobond in September, external reserves have trended downwards, according to the first quarter 2022 report of the FSDH Research, an arm of FSDH Holding Company Limited. Lower oil production below the budgeted benchmark despite high crude oil price led to limited foreign currency inflows needed to boost the reserves. The economy recorded lower net foreign exchange inflow in January, driven, mainly, by net flows from the CBN and autonomous sources, the CBN’s economic report for January 2022 stated. Aggregate foreign exchange inflow into the economy declined by 36.7 percent to US$4.36 billion in January 2022, from US$6.89 billion in December 2021. The total foreign exchange outflow decreased by 5.1 percent to US$3.41 billion, from US$3.59 billion in the preceding period. A net inflow of US$0.95 billion was recorded in the month under review, compared with net inflow of US$3.29 billion in the preceding period.
