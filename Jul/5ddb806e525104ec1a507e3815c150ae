 Timaya has had a stellar year with Cold Outside still dominating global charts and his last album “Gratitude” still getting various nominations across the continent almost two years after release. He recently crowned that success with the iconic Ferrari 458 and a majestic penthouse mansion in Ikoyi. Timaya is currently all about securing the bag as he follows up all the success with his new single fittingly titled “Get My Money Right”. The song depicts where Timaya is currently in his career, which is a square focus on his music and getting his money right while avoiding any distractions or hate from the public generally.
