 Netflix names Microsoft as a sales partner for a new consumer subscription plan to help power their first ad-supported subscription offering. This will allow consumers to have more options to access Netflix’s award-winning content. Marketers looking to Microsoft for their advertising needs will have access to the Netflix audience and premium connected TV inventory. All ads served on Netflix will be exclusively available through the Microsoft platform. “In April we announced that we will introduce a new lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan for consumers, in addition to our existing ads-free basic, standard, and premium plans. We are pleased to announce that we have selected Microsoft as our global advertising technology and sales partner,” Greg Peters, COO of Netflix said.
