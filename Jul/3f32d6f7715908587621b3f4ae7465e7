 MTN Group Ltd. is in talks to buy smaller domestic rival Telkom SA SOC Ltd. in a deal that would combine South Africa’s second and third-largest telecommunications operators.
According to Bloomberg, MTN would pay for the partially state-owned company in shares or a combination of cash and stock, according to a statement on Friday. Discussions are at an early stage and there is no certainty the transaction will be completed, the carriers said. Telkom shares soared 15%, the most since September, valuing the company at almost 20 billion rand ($1.2 billion).
