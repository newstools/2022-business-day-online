 The International Committee of the All African Music Awards (AFRIMA) is reminding all artistes, music professionals and other relevant stakeholders within Africa and across the diaspora to submit their entries for the 2022 AFRIMA edition, before the portal closes on August 5, 2022. According to Hadja Kobele Keita, AFRIMA Juror, representing Diaspora Northern America, the award platform would not extend the submission date beyond August 5, 2022. “It is important that all relevant parties submit their entries on time this year. We are a very thorough and transparent organisation; and we have a clear process for the award ceremony every year. Once submission of entries ends, we spend time in judging the materials, before we can derive our final nominations list. We also have a specific time allotted to voting. The entire process is also audited by a firm of international repute, Pricewaterhousecoopers. We do not just wake up and nominate people. AFRIMA 2022 will be held from November 3-6, 2022. To achieve this, we cannot extend deadlines at this point.” According to AFRIMA, all prospective entries must have been created between August 20, 2021 and August 5, 2022, being the year-in-review for all submissions. Artistes, artiste managers, music producers, recording companies/labels, video directors, disc jockeys and other relevant stakeholders can submit their work or submit on behalf of their clients via the official AFRIMA website at www.afrima.org. All submissions must be done in consonance with AFRIMA guidelines, terms and conditions, which are also available on the website.
