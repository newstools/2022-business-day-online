Commenting on some of the other unique features of 9TV, Okonkwo said that apart from having all the major features and services a media and entertainment app should have, it allows users to watch whatever they want/like at their convenience. 9TV’s ‘Timeshift’ feature on Live TV allows users to watch their favourite programmes with pause, rewind, and forward functionalities. Also, the ‘Catch-Up’ feature will enable users to watch programmes after they have been broadcast, or users who have missed a live broadcast will be able to view it on demand. 9TV allows users to watch & also download their favourite movies, which they will be able to watch later under ‘my downloads’ feature on the app. The downloaded movies will be available to users to view whenever they want, even with ‘No Network Coverage’ or when the device is on ‘Airplane Mode’. Another unique offering on 9TV is Liv.9ja; an on-demand live entertainment streaming section that allows users to watch live concerts, interviews, parties, and similar events. Since entering the Nigerian market, 9mobile has consistently affirmed its commitment to customers with quality and affordable products and service offerings.
