Since 2019, startups in Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt have raised 83 percent of all funding and signed 78 percent of all $1 million-plus deals., and there is no indication that things will change anytime soon, as these percentages have been very consistent over time. According to Max Cuvellier, GSMA’s head of mobile for development (M4D), “There’s no denying that the context is difficult and between inflation, food insecurity, bear markets, supply chain issues, and more, African start-ups will be impacted in their growth and capacity to raise.” However, the third quarter (Q3) will be decisive, especially given how strong it was last year, but there is definitely room for optimism. Let’s hope that future figures don’t contradict me too much, he said.
