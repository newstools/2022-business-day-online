 Twitter was on fire Wednesday as rumours of defection went viral online about Jimi Agbaje, former Lagos Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate. The news went viral following a blog post on a Nigerian online news platform (not Businessday). ‘‘A former governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Lagos state, Jimi Agbaje, has defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC),” the blog posted, attributing the information to a Facebook by an APC faithful. However, the three-time governorship candidate took to his Twitter handle to dismiss the story as rumour. He tweeted in Yoruba that it is the turn of Nigerians and not anyone else. “Eyin ko lo kan o. Nigerians lokan. Jimi Agbaje – PDP,” he tweeted, subtly referencing Bola Tinubu’s popular Abeokuta speech. Agbaje has been a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since 2011 and had previously contested for the Lagos governorship seat on the party’s platform. He lost in all two attempts to the AC and APC candidate. He however wasn’t an aspirant for the 2023 PDP ticket for the Lagos gubernatorial election as a new candidate, Olajide Adediran Jandor won the Party primaries.
