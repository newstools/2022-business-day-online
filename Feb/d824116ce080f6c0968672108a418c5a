The APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) has notified the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that the party will hold its Zonal Congresses on March 26. That will be exactly one month after the February 26 National Convention date. The officials that will emerge at the Zonal Congresses are going to be statutory delegates to the Convention. BusinessDay reported at the weekend that the Convention of the ruling party hanged in the balance one week to the D-Day as the party faithful could not tell whether the much-anticipated exercise is holding as scheduled or not That followed the disagreements over the issues surrounding consensus and zoning arrangements for the offices, especially that of the National Chairman which tore even Governors of the party and other leaders apart, sending signals that the event would be shifted.
