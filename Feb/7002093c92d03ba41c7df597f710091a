 Nigerian technology firms stand a chance to gain as Saudi Arabia is collaborating with the Nigerian government through the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy for its new Start-up Passport. The initiative is being driven by the Digital Cooperation Organisation (DCO), a multinational organisation established by the Kingdom. It was announced at the LEAP technology conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday. The DCO startup passport is expected to make it quicker, easier, and less expensive for start-ups to do business across borders, opening up potentially lucrative markets with a combined population of more than half a billion people. “The Start-up Passport reduces administrative and financial burdens and accelerates corporate registration and other processes for entrepreneurs,” said Deem Al-Yahya, secretary-general of the DCO. Through this passport, they will be able to enter the markets of other DCO member states. This will further our mission of coordinating efforts and sharing expertise to grow the digital economy for the benefit of all nations.” The initiative will be rolled out initially in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. There are plans to also rollout out in Bahrain and five other countries. The Start-up Passport provides expedited entry and support in the markets of eight DCO countries. The Nigerian side of the collaboration is being championed by Isa Pantami, minister of Communications and Digital Economy who was accompanied to the event by heads of NCC and NITDA. “The DCO has been very supportive to Nigeria and we are among the major beneficiaries of the initiative,” Ali Isa Pantami told BusinessDay. He added that “DCO gave us a slot at the conference for free, pavilion for free, support in many areas for our start-ups and they have places to display their products. They are willing to listen to what they have been doing and see what they can do to support them.” For participating Nigerian start-ups, the initiative opens new opportunities in the Middle East which has a combined population of more than half a billion people and a combined GDP of nearly $2 trillion. While Nigerian tech companies have made significant inroads in Africa, access to markets outside the continent has often come at a steep price and sometimes many are discouraged from making the push.

Hence, while many of them are tapping market opportunities within the Kingdom, expanding to other countries is not so simple. Part of the challenges is the long list of administrative processes required to establish a business in many countries. The Start-up Passport is expected to bridge the gap, reduce administrative, financial burdens and accelerate corporate registration and other processes for entrepreneurs in one DCO member state to enter the markets of other DCO member states. The passport provides expedited entry and support in the markets of eight DCO countries in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa. The initiative will be rolled out initially in Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Bahrain.
