He urges operators to adhere to all regulatory directives and to ensure prompt and efficient delivery on their licensing conditions as good corporate citizens while promising that NCC will continue to take proactive measures that would improve their operations. The commission pledged necessary collaborations to ensure sustainability of the sector and its contribution to the growth of nation’s economy, while stating that the tour of operators’ facilities was in line with NCC’s effort to ensure effective stakeholders interface necessary for the achievement of the objectives detailed in the Commission’s Strategic Management Plan (SMP) 2020-2024 and the Strategic Vision (Implementation) Plan (SVIP) 2021-2025. “The main purpose of this inspection tour of MNOs’ head offices and key facilities is to measure impact of regulatory efforts and operational effectiveness of the initiatives in the telecom ecosystem. The tour is also to assist in deepening understanding of the issues that are negatively affecting the ability of licensees to operate optimally; and it certainly offered an opportunity for interacting and networking with executive management of MNOs in order to enhance operator-regulatory purposeful interface,” Adewolu said. Meanwhile, the operators commended the Commission for ensuring effective telecom regulatory regime towards addressing challenges confronting their operations and also implored the NCC delegation to continue to develop initiatives aimed at reducing the impact of their major operational challenges on the service delivery and their revenues.
