During the launch of the project fund, Bola Badmus, the project director for the Black Business Advancement said through the National Ecosystem Fund, the CIA will build a truly-supportive business ecosystem that helps black businesses transition smoothly from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and incubate new businesses through the value chain from ideation to inclined profitability. Similarly, Popoola Akande, the president of CIA noted that access to capital is a key factor for most businesses, especially SMEs, so they have made it their core offering to support the business network with credit advisory services. “There are opportunities out there, change the way you think about business, think big and let’s do it”,” Akande added. It is no longer news that the CIA, a community and economic development organization in Alberta, Western Canada has been making new waves and breaking new barriers in positioning black businesses including start-ups for greater economic opportunities, with a focus on building institutional capacity.
