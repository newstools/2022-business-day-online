 The British American Tobacco Nigeria Foundation has commenced the third cohort of its Farmers for the Future (F4F) grant project. The programme, which is aimed at empowering young agripreneurs in Nigeria, provides a great opportunity for young and enthusiastic graduates with viable agri-businesses, requiring equity-free capital for their enterprises to access up to N6 million to upscale their businesses. The F4F Cohort 3 is targeted at serving National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members, aged 18 years and above, and is part of BATN Foundation’s drive to encourage and promote youth engagement in profitable and sustainable agriculture. The initiative is developed and sponsored by the BATN Foundation in partnership with NYSC.
