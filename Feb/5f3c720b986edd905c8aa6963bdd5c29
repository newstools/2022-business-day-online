 Kids That Code (KTC), an initiative aimed at empowering kids for the future by encouraging them to code early, has partnered with a Chess In Slums Africa – a non-profit to help rehabilitated teenagers find life-changing opportunities, by unlocking their innate potentials through the skill of coding. Kids That Code, since its inception in 2018, has impacted over 2,000 children, creating a safe community where kids and teenagers interested in learning, building, and sharing tech knowledge, can thrive. The partnership will see these youngsters rehabilitated by Chess In Slums Africa, equipped with the tools, mentorship, and vital skills required to conquer the world. Also, the partnership, which will begin with a five-week intensive coding camp, is made possible by donations from sponsors such as Get Equity, Flutterwave and Venture Garden Group (VGG).

Also, Jude Dike, founder of GetEquity said that “we have argued here the benefits of the pipeline from the streets to tech vs getting into “yahoo.” Well a few of us have decided to test this theory.” Individuals and organisations interested to donate to the initiative can follow the link https://bit.ly/donatetoktc to make donations.
