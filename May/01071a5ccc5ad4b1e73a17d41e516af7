The former governor of Kwara said that Nigeria needed a president with action and courage to stand and take some very bold decisions to reposition the nation. Saraki said, “Please, let me appeal to you, I am your own. Let us work together to ensure that we win at the federal and win at the state. “There is nobody among all the aspirants that has the same history and closeness to Lagos State as myself.
