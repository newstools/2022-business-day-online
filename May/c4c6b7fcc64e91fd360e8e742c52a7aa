 The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has disowned a news item that it intends to replace the naira notes in circulation with digital currency, the eNaira, in due course. In a telephone conversation with journalists in Abuja over the weekend, Osita Nwanisobi, director, corporate communications department of the apex bank, disclaimed that the statement purported to have been made during a stakeholders’ engagement on eNaira adoption in Asaba, Delta State was misconstrued and therefore called on the general public to disregard such in its entirety.

Nwanisobi therefore, urged members of the public and business owners to embrace the digital currency, the eNaira as it offers more possibilities.
