The Future Generations Fund – a second component of the SWFund returned 11.98% for the year. Private Equity/Venture Capital was the best performing asset class with a return of 23% for the year. Developed Equity and Hedge funds also performed well in 2021, with returns of 17.5% and 12.8%. However, Emerging Markets Equity had a negative return of -1.92% for the year and was the worst performer, and according to Uche Orji, Managing Director, NSIA ,is a major concern. 9. The Stabilisation Fund, which is the third component, is invested in US sovereign debt instruments and Investment Grade Corporate Credit. At the end of December 2021, according to Orji, 21% of the fund was invested in a portfolio of US treasury bonds tracking the Bloomberg Barclays US Treasury bond 1–3-year index. The Growth Assets part of the fund is invested in short duration bond funds (23%) and Structured products (53%). Also, the Fund has a 3% allocation to a China Bond Fund which is expected to provide diversified returns and returned 1.60% for the year. The US Treasury bond portfolio returned -0.64%, while the short duration bond funds returned -0.58%.
The Structured products were the best performing component, returning 3.69% for the year, Orji noted. 10. Outlook for 2022: Despite gains in past years, Orji thinks that 2022 will be the toughest year of investing globally, as Central banks battle to navigate inflation without dampening growth. Global commodity prices continue to surge as the Russia-Ukraine crisis enters a new phase, coupled with an impending food crisis. According to him, the financial performance of the NSIA for 2022 will be impacted by the rapidly crystalizing headwinds, with a significant portfolio restructuring in the Future Generations Fund to diversify the portfolio, improve the risk/return profile, and generate liquidity through secondary transactions. However, the Infrastructure Fund will remain resilient and NSIA hopes to begin to recycle funds from investee companies. He also notes that Asset transfers will be an important component of NSIA funding strategy in the mid to long term, as it hopes to prioritize Environment, Social and Governance, both as an asset class and in the investment process
