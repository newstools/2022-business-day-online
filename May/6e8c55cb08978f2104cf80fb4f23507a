 Nigerian oil and gas stocks have gained 61.72 percent year-to-date (YTD), making them the best-performing stocks compared to other sectors, according to data compiled by BusinessDay. Their performance is mainly down to higher oil prices, with Brent crude, the benchmark against which Nigeria’s oil is priced, rising 43 percent since the beginning of the year. Seplat recorded the highest YTD return of 100.02 percent compared to its peers. Its share price stood at N1300.1 on Monday, up from N650 at the beginning of the trading year.

Following oil and gas, the industrial goods stocks gained 14.2 percent while the consumer goods sector and banking sector gained 17.77 percent and 7.15 percent respectively in the period under review. Ayodele Oni, a partner, energy practice group at Bloomfield LP, said that rising oil and gas prices are key drivers for the improved investor sentiment towards oil and gas stocks.    A breakdown of the top oil firms in Nigeria showed Seplat’s revenue grew to N100.6 billion in the first quarter of this year, the highest revenue compared to its peers. Total Energies earned N97.6 billion, and Eterna (N26.8 billion), Conoil (N26.2 billion), and MRS (N17.9 billion). Oni said the performance of the oil and gas firms is sustainable in the short and medium-term. “I think it is sustainable in the short term, and medium-term but in the long term, no, because of decarbonisation and net zero, unless they diversify into energy and gas which many of them are already doing,” Oni said. Seplat grew its revenue by 74 percent to N100.6 billion in the first three months of 2022, although its profit declined by 12 percent to N8.3 billion from N9.45 billion in the comparable period.
