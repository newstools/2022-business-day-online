In our opinion, the positive corporate performance in first-quarter (Q1) 2022 should spur buying interest. Furthermore, tickers across sectors still have significant upside, which could stimulate bargain hunting activities,” Lagos-based Meristem research analysts said. Though, the analysts noted a possibility of profit taking on tickers that have gained appreciably during the past weeks, especially on bellwether stocks, they however think that the positive factors would be dominant. “Hence, we expect the market to close in the positive region this week,” Meristem research analysts added.
