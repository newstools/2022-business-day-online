 Leofied, an online community that connects consumers and businesses to freelance service professionals, has launched a freelance platform to strengthen commerce and the workforce across Africa. With a target of $20 billion in freelance commerce over the next couple of years, Leofied plans to disrupt and improve the industry in Nigeria and across Africa. “There are a couple of freelance platforms in Africa but most have failed to cater for the needs of African freelancers in Africa. We could see how our workforce struggled during the pandemic. With Leofied, we seek to bridge this gap, improve on the lapses and provide a platform for this fast springing workforce to thrive on,” Jonathan Frank Omonigho, CEO, Leofied said. The platform provides a route for financial freedom for Nigerians and Africans allowing them to make money without limits from the comfort of their homes.
