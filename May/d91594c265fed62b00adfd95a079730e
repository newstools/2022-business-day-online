 The cost of living for Nigerians has spiked, as food prices across the country rose by 25.6percent in one year, a BusinessDay analysis shows. According to the recent Selected Food Price Watch for April 2022 by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the aggregate average price of 43 food items across the country increased by 26 percent to N36, 586.2 from N29, 119.8. Ayorinde Akinloye, an investment and research analyst at United Capital plc said the steep surge in food prices in April was largely due to strong demand resulting from the festivities of Ramadan and Easter whereas food supply remains short as insecurity in the North and legacy structural deficiencies continue to limit food output. Food, a basic necessity for human survival, takes almost 60 percent of household expenditure. Data from NBS show that in 2019, total household expenditure in Nigeria stood at N40 trillion out of which N22. 7 trillion was spent on food alone. In April, Nigeria’s food inflation rose 2.0 percent points higher to 18.37 percent, the highest in seven months compared to 17.20 percent in March. On how the increase in food prices is affecting households, Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst noted that they are having a poorer living standard as a greater portion of their budget goes to food-related expenses, leading to less savings and investment. “In essence, the astronomical increase we see in food prices lowers their purchasing power and living standards.” A breakdown of the NBS report shows that the average price of 1kg of beans (white, black eye, sold loose) rose on a year-on-year basis by 44.3 percent to N519.1 in April 2022 from N359.6 in April 2021. Also, on a month-on-month basis, this increased by 2.6 percent from N505.9 in March 2022. The average price of 500g of bread increased on a year-on-year basis by 35.31 percent from N333.0 in April 2021 to N450.5 in April 2022. On a month-on-month basis, the average price of this item increased by 0.6 percent in April 2022.
