 President Muhammadu Buhari Saturday afternoon signed into law the recently amended 2022 electoral act, a lawmaker has said. The electoral act has been a bone of contention for a while as the House of Representatives, Senate and other politicians were excluded from voting in their parties’ primaries by the 2022 electoral act. Following the omission, both the Senate and House of Representatives last week convened emergency sessions where they amended the act to provide for statutory delegates to vote and be voted for in the forthcoming political parties primaries and conventions. However, with few days left for the primaries to take place, politicians have been pressuring the president to sign it in order to avert crisis.
