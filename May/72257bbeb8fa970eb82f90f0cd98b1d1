 Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the governor of Lagos State has said that the expression of interest and nomination forms of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) for him to run for a second term in office was bought for him by Bola Tinubu. Sanwo-Olu made this known on Friday through his Chief Press Secretary, Gboyega Akosile via a tweet. Quoting Sanwo-Olu, Gboyega tweeted: “Asiwaju Tinubu paid for my second term nomination and expression of interest forms to run for the second term, says Sanwo-Olu”.  This should put to rest the speculations on social media that Tinubu told Sanwo-Olu he should forget about the second term as he had switched his support for a former Permanent Secretary in the Lagos State Civil Service, Mustapha Olorunfemi. There had been speculation that despite the Governor’s Advisory Council of which Tinubu is the leader endorsing Sanwo-Olu, Tinubu had rejected the governor’s passionate plea to be allowed a second term in office.
