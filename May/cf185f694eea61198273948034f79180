 In response to the presidential directive for all ministers interested in the 2023 elections, Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, has resigned his position in the cabinet of President Muhammadu Buhari. The Imo politician tendered his resignation on Wednesday after President Muhammadu Buhari issued a directive for all ministers and aides seeking elective offices next year to resign. The tenure of the minister is tainted with unceasing industrial actions by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) . The most recent industrial action kicked off on February 14 with no hope of resolution in sight.
