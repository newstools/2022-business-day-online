 The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it is too late to tinker with the schedule of activities for the 2023 general elections. Festus Okoye, INEC national commissioner and chairman, information and voter education committee, stated this while speaking on Monday in Abuja. Okoye spoke against the backdrop of the two months extension of the deadline for the conduct of the parties’ primary elections recently sought by the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC). According to him, any change in the June 3 deadline will affect other activities for elections. “The timetable and schedule of activities released by the commission are derived from the constitution, the Electoral Act and the Regulations and Guidelines of the commission. “The chairman of the commission, Mahmood Yakubu, made it clear that our timetable and schedule of activities and the terminal date for the conduct of party primaries are firm and fixed. “The political parties are proceeding with their congresses and primaries. The commission will not tamper with its fixtures, as doing so will affect other activities and constitutionally-circumscribed timelines. “Certainty is key to planning, and the commission is committed to its timelines. Political parties must brace up to the challenges posed by the Electoral Act 2022,” he said. Okoye, who said that the commission was already engaged with lots of activities, said it would amount to arbitrariness to adjust the election timetable.

Moreover, we have trained and deployed hundreds of monitors for the congresses and primaries,’’ he said. Okoye, therefore, stated that it was too late to interfere with the timelines, stressing that the commission had released the timetable and schedule on February 26.
