Nevertheless, we advise investors not to panic and rather take advantage of the dip to increase positions in attractively priced fundamental stocks,” said analysts at Lagos-based United Capital. Union Bank, Transcorp, Access Bank, Jaiz Bank, and Sterling Bank were most traded stocks on the Exchange on Monday. In 4,586 deals, investors exchanged 27,564,562,311 units valued at N194.356billion. “This week, barring any significant gain on heavy-weight tickers, we expect the market to close in the negative zone. We see room for profit taking activities on tickers that have gained appreciably in recent weeks. “Likewise, we consider the recent uptick in rates in the fixed income environment and how this may negatively impact investors’ participation in the equities market. Overall, we expect the market to close in the negative region this week,” Meristem analysts said in their May 30 note to investors.
