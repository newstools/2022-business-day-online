What experts are saying Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) About 45 percent of the production cost of manufacturers in Nigeria is spent on electricity and this is making them uncompetitive within and beyond Africa. According to the Chairman, Infrastructure Committee, MAN, Ibrahim Usman, “the high cost of electricity across the country was making indigenous producers uncompetitive.” Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) According to the Chamber, the uptick in inflation weakens purchasing power and consequently worsens the poverty conditions, adding that the situation equally escalates operating and production costs and erodes profit margins and ultimately undermines investors’ confidence. LCCI President, Toki Mabogunje, noted that the key inflationary drivers are basically supply-side issues, which are beyond monetary policy control.
