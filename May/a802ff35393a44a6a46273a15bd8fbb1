 Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has approached the Federal High court in Abuja to seek a constitutional interpretation of his non-resignation while pursuing his political ambition. The CBN Governor has been a subject of public criticism in recent days after a coalition purchased the N100 million expression of interest and nomination forms of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) for him. But on Saturday, Emefiele, on his Twitter handle thanked those who bought the forms for him, saying he was undecided and would buy the forms with his money if he decides to contest. The suit was filed on Monday at the Abuja division of the Federal High Court by Mike Ozekhome who is his counsel. Joined in the suit are the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF).
