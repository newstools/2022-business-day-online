 Nigerian largest banks are raking in profits from information and communications technology (IT) as the industry is increasingly reliant on emerging digital technologies to attract and retain customers. Total income from the electronic businesses of Nigeria’s four largest banks rose to over N189.43 billion in 2021, up from N139.19 billion recorded in 2020, according to data compiled by BusinessDay.

Although the steady increase in e-banking revenue is beneficial for banks, customers embrace any innovation that makes financial transactions simple and convenient. Many customers have continued to complain about the charges associated with their transactions, which may lead them to seek cheaper options. It is important to note that the high charges would limit the progress of financial inclusion as customers will avoid operating a bank account. It has been established by several surveys that customers are very sensitive to charges, Ayodeji Ebo, an investment professional, notes. In the short to medium term, low transaction fees will be a major selling factor for banks, as customers will migrate to banks with the lowest charges.
