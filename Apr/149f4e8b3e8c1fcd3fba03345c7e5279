 Nigeria’s headline inflation rate witnessed yet another significant uptick in the month of March as it increased by 15.92 percent on the back of soaring food and energy prices. Nigeria’s consumer price growth surpassed 15 per cent in March, its fastest pace since last year following a surge in the cost of energy and food, maintaining pressure on the CBN to take decisive actions to tackle inflation. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), in its Consumer Price Index report released on Tuesday, attributed the marginal increase to surge in global energy prices which has lingered all through the months of February and March as a result of the increased price of diesel as a result of scarcity emanating from ongoing crisis between Russia and Ukraine. Headline inflation increased by about 0.22 percent higher than the 15.70 percent witnessed in February inflation report.
