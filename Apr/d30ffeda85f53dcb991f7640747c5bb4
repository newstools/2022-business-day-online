 Directors of listed companies on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) traded N44.82 billion worth of their shares in the first three months of 2022, with trading in the shares of BUA Foods on January 5, 2022 accounting for 90 percent of the insider dealings. Trading in the shares of listed companies by their directors are regarded as ‘insider dealings’, which require the concerned firms to update the NGX, which in turn notifies the investing community. According to an investment expert, Fahd Dameer, directors of companies can sell their own shares for reasons that include payment of tax, purchasing a property, retirement or resignation, and when the company sees the market as inflated. Shares could be purchased if they are part of their total salary packages or issued when options are converted, among other reasons.
