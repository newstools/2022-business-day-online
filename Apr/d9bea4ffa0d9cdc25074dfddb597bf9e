 Nigeria’s listed equities gained about N486billion in the four-day trading week ended April 22, 2022, thanks to Oil & Gas and Consumer Goods stocks. The market which defied most analysts’ expectation of sell-pressure trended northward after recording three (3) positive closes and one (1) negative out of the four trading days in the holiday shortened week. The first-quarter (Q1) results of some listed companies which hit the market in the review week as well as other corporate disclosures helped drive the market’s positive sentiments. The stock market’s positive return year-to-date (YtD) increased to 13.44percent at the end of the review week’s trading. Week-on-week (WoW), the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) All-Share Index (ASI) and Market Capitalisation appreciated by 2percent in the four-day trading week to 48,459.65 points and N26.125trillion respectively from week-open lows of 47,558.45 points and N25.639 trillion.
