 Bukola Saraki, a presidential aspirant under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has promised that after he becomes the President of Nigeria, banditry and kidnapping will be a thing of the past. According to him, Nigeria is in a state that needs desperate intervention, especially in the areas of insecurity and poverty. Saraki stated this on Monday at PDP Secretariat in Akure, the Ondo state capital when he met with the state delegates to seek their support for his aspiration of becoming the PDP presidential flagbearer. The former senate president said, “this is not the country we deserve, after I become President, there will be no more banditry and kidnapping in this country. I assure you that I will do more as president. We can fix, rescue and rebuild this country.
