 Kemi Elebute-Halle, governorship candidate of Action Democratic Party (ADP) has accused the three main political parties and their governorship candidates of monetising the gubernatorial election by buying votes from the electorate. This allegation was corroborated by some news items credited to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) which confirmed the arrest of some suspects that engaged in votes buying. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) said that the suspects were caught with packages continuing money and books containing details of voters in certain polling units. Elebute-Halle, who spoke shortly after she cast her vote at the Polling Unit 008, Ward 10, Ikole LGA in Ekiti, alleged that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) paid N10,000 each to induce voters; the People’s Democratic Party paid N5,000 each and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) paid N3,000 each. “At my polling unit here — ward 10, unit eight — we are aware that APC has started buying votes for the sum of N10,000; PDP are buying for N5,000 and SDP for N3,000.
