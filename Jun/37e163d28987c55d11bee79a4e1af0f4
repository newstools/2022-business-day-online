 Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Ishtaye has called on the international community to move from condemnation to imposing sanctions on Israel in light of “daily” aggression against Palestinians. Ishtaye made the remarks while addressing a European celebration held in the West Bank city of Ramallah attended by representatives of Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway.
He said Israel’s endless daily aggression, including the displacement and the killing of Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, constitutes a real disaster.
