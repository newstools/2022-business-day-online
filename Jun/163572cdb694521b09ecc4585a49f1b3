 Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has alleged a gang-up by northern All Progressives Congress (APC), against his 2023 Presidential ambition. The governor who insisted that he is still in the race, alleged that the governors have excluded him from aspirants eligible to contest the party’s presidential ticket. Bello who stated this on Tuesday, after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, said not allowing him to vie for the ticket is a recipe for chaos. According to him, he is the overwhelming favorite to clinch the ticket if there is a transparent and credible process. Bello declared that he cannot withdraw from the race unless told to do so by President Buhari. “Getting into the arena today, I will win overwhelmingly if the process is credible,” he said. The governor said the president has not told him to step down from the race.
He said there was no need for him to be excluded in the primary, claiming that he represents the youths and the downtrodden.
