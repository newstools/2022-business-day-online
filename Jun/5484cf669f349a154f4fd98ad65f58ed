We also do not see any significant positive trigger to spur buying interest in the market. Moreover, foreign inflows into the Nigerian equities market remain low as per the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) report. “Also, we note the Treasury bills auction coming up during the week amid the low market liquidity which can lead to profit-taking in anticipation of higher rates at the auction. Therefore, we expect the market to close the week in the negative region,” Meristem analysts had said in their June 6 note.
