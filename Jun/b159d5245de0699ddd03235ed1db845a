 Chinedu Nwajiuba, younger brother of former minister of state for education and All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential aspirant, Emeka Nwajiuba has explained why his elder brother did not attend the APC convention at the Eagle square in Abuja. The former minister, who was regarded as one of the key contestants, was visibly absent at the convention. His name was called several times to come out to address the APC convention but he was not available. In a statement he issued last night, the younger Nwajiuba who is the immediate past Vice chancellor of Federal University Ndufu Ebonyi State said his brother was betrayed by the leadership of the party. “Many friends are calling to find out why my brother, Dr. Hon. Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba did not come out to address the APC convention. “Simple. The understanding from the highest levels prior to his involvement, and considering his role in the founding of the APC was that of consensus as was with the National Chairmanship a few months ago. “With that understanding, the Presidential ticket was to come to the South, and the South East,” he said. According to him, “This has been the hope till the end of the negotiations. He, not wanting to be part of the Dollar and Naira bazaar, is convinced that what Nigeria needs now is no more of the same thing that has kept Nigeria at the low level it has been. “Our challenges as a country cannot be addressed at the same energy level by which they were created.
