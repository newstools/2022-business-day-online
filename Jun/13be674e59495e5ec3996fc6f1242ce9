 Web 3.0, also known as the third generation of the internet and driven by blockchain, is poised to revolutionize technology and venture capital, and riding its growing awareness, Binance has announced a multi-year partnership with TikTok influencer Khaby Lame to increase awareness and adoption. With more than 144 million followers on TikTok and 78 million followers on Instagram, Khaby Lame recently surpassed all other creators as the platform’s most popular user. The blockchain company is looking to take advantage of his appeal to the younger demographic by working with Binance to create exclusive NFT collections, further enhancing the experience for his fans. “I consider my followers as my family, and I am always looking for new challenges and interesting content to share with them,” Khaby Lame said. “I’ve been curious about Web3 for some time, and jumped at the chance to partner with a leader like Binance because it aligns perfectly with what I usually do: make complex stuff easy and fun for everyone!” Read also: The Weeknd, Binance partner for first crypto powered world tour Frequently critics have labeled Web 3.0 a new Silicon Valley cliché that will cause more problems than it resolves.

We love his charm and sense of humor, and think it will bring relevance and relatability as we scale Web3 adoption,” said Rothwell
