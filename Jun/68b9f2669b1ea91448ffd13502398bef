 In just three weeks, about 1.2 million youths have been fully registered. The youth registrants make up more than half of the 2 million people who have completed their voter registration during this period. In a tweet this morning, Anap Foundation, initiator of the #GoNigeria initiative, expressed gratitude to INEC and other key players. “The initiative began its youth registration drive hoping to get 15 million youths to register and obtain their Permanent Voter’s Cards (PVCs), and as of June 27, INEC has registered 14.1 million youths,” Anap said.  There are high hopes that the number of youth voters will increase. Recently, at the #YouthVoteCount held at the Old Parade Ground, Abuja on June 25, Mahmood Yakubu, INEC chairman reiterated that the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) process will be extended. The process was due to end by June 30.  The south-eastern region still recorded the least amount of completed voter registration, despite INEC’s effort in deploying 209 additional machines to all 5 states in the south-eastern region, as well as Lagos and Kano, as mentioned in its press statement from June 10.
