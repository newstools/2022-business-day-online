 The House of Representatives has urged the National Lottery Regulatory Commission to ensure that all Gaming operators in Nigeria integrate the National Identity (NIN) in their data collection. The House decision followed the adoption of a motion moved by Ibrahim Isiaka (APC, Ogun) at plenary on Thursday. Isiaka noted in his motion that the global gaming market is undoubtedly a huge one estimated to generate between $400 to $500 billion yearly and with the consistency of the current trends, by 2022, it is set to be worth around $565 billion with increasing amounts of revenues coming from online gaming in its many forms. He observed that when such large amounts of money are exchanged and transacted quickly through relatively anonymous interactions, there is a significant risk that criminals will be tempted to use the situation for money laundering.

While adopting the motion, the House mandated its committee on Governmental Affairs to ensure compliance.
