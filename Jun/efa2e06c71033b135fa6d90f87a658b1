 Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Meta, the parent company of Facebook is leaving after serving the company for 14 years. Sheryl Sandberg joined Meta, formerly known as Facebook, in 2008 as the second in command of the social media giant. It was a time when the company was still trying to find its bearing and exploring new ideas. Sandberg led a transformation in the company’s strategy that has seen Meta become one of the most valuable tech companies with a market cap that has grown to about $1 trillion at one point. In a post on Facebook, Sandberg said she had Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder and CEO, to thank for the achievement she recorded in the company.

“Sitting by Mark’s side for these 14 years has been the honor and privilege of a lifetime. Mark is a true visionary and a caring leader. He sometimes says that we grew up together, and we have. He was just 23 and I was already 38 when we met, but together we have been through the massive ups and downs of running this company,” Sandberg noted in her post. Sheryl Sandberg is handing over to Javier Olivan, the current chief growth officer of Meta. She however continues to serve on Meta’s board of directors. Sandberg also plans to devote more time to her family, foundation, and philanthropic work.
