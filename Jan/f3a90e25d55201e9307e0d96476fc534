 The year 2021 was a roller-coaster for equities, with eight months of positive returns and four month of bearish season. The market ended with a positive return of 6.7 percent amid a remarkable last-minute rally that helped push the value of listed stocks up by N1.23 trillion. Interestingly, market liquidity and the record rally were driven majorly by domestic institutional and retail investors, thus reinforcing the potential of Nigerian investors in stabilising and growing the market. Notwithstanding imminent risks to equity market rally in 2022, Nigerian stocks are still attractive and should remain resilient in this year. The big question now is: what stocks should investors buy in 2022? Stocks seen reoccurring in many analysts BUY lists for 2022, which investors should actively consider in their equities portfolio this year include Dangote Cement, MTN Nigeria, Lafarge Africa, GTCO, Nestle Nigeria, Zenith Bank, BUA Cement, BUA Foods, UBA, Fidelity Bank, Access Bank, Stanbic IBTC Holdings, and Flour Mills of Nigeria. Currently in the Nigerian market, many of these stocks are undervalued and present attractive BUY opportunities for investors seeking both capital appreciation and for long-term returns. “Companies such as Dangote Cement, MTN Nigeria, GTCO, Nestle and Zenith Bank, which are our top picks, are resilient bellwethers with the history of sustaining earnings growth through political cycles,” according to Isaac Olorungbon, chief executive, Deep Trust and Investments Limited. He remains upbeat on the prospect of the Nigerian stock market in 2022, “as our cautious optimism reinforces our outlook of another positive return for Nigerian equity investors in the new year.” Others are: Unilever Nigeria, Okomu Oil Palm, Presco, Vitafoam, Berger Paints, Ardova, Seplat, and Total Energies Marketing Nigeria. Also on analysts BUY list are Dangote Sugar Refinery, Guinness Nigeria, Conoil, FCMB Group, May & Baker, Fidson Healthcare, and Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals. Amid increasing optimism in the market, a likely modest rise in the interest rate environment may undermine funds flow to equities in 2022, but a positive earnings outlook across most largely capitalised value stocks should reinforce the investment opportunities in these stocks. Dangote Cement Dangote Cement is Africa’s leading cement producer with existing operations in 10 African countries with a production capacity of 48.6 million tons per year. The company’s share price as of January 10, 2022, was N260 per share; year-to-date (YtD) change (+1.2%), while in year 2021 the stock rose by +4.9 percent. Meristem analysts target price (TP) for Dangote Cement is N287.81; Vetiva analysts target price for the stock is N280; while United Capital analysts target price is N270.3. Going by these analysts 2022 target price for the cement maker, the stock has upside potential and should be considered a BUY. BUY rating is given to a stock considered highly undervalued, but with strong fundamentals, and where potential return in excess of or equal to 15 percent is expected to be realised between its current price and analysts’ target price (TP).

Thus data revenue is projected to come in at N647 billion, up 25 percent year-on-year (y/y). “Given that the NCC has lifted the suspension of new SIM card registrations, and with the company also hinting that it is actively ramping up new-registration centres, which will support the FG’s NIN enrolment programme, we expect to see some gains in MTNN’s subscriber base going forward. Thus, we expect this to somewhat provide a support system for voice revenue through 2022. However, we also bear in mind that voice services are subject to stiff competition, given the growing preference for internet-driven cheaper substitutes. “With the company now underway to getting a PSB licence, product offerings are up for a full-blown scale-up, and we might start to see considerable impact on MTN’s top-line performance,” according to Victoria Ejugwu, oil & gas, telecom’s analyst at Lagos-based Vetiva. “Going forward into the 2022, we are guided by our recent Nigerian telecom sector report ‘Delivering a Digital Future,’ December 30, in which we recommend a BUY for MTNN with target price of N266.17/share and a Sell for Airtel Africa with a target price of N793.84/share,” according to Coronation Research analysts in their January 4 note.
