 The Federal Government’s recently imposed Excise Duty on non-alcoholic drinks will have a positive impact on the country’s revenue, Bismark Rewane, CEO of Financial Derivatives Company Limited, said. “It however punishes the poor who are buying cheaper drinks,” Rewane said at the 2022 Economic Outlook event hosted by the Nigerian British Chamber of Commerce, Thursday. The Federal Government introduced an Excise Duty of N10 per litre on all non-alcoholic, carbonated, and sweetened beverages. The new policy, now referred to as ‘Sugar Tax,’ is contained in the Finance Act signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari on December 31, 2021. Rewane also mentioned that the Federal Government could have taxed the people producing sugar instead of those consuming it.
