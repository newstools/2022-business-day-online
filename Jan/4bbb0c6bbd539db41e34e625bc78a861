 In a move to solve Nigeria’s leadership crisis and inculcate new orientation among young aspiring leaders, the School of Politics, Policy and Governance will hold a convocation for its pioneer students, Class of 2021, on Saturday, January 29, 2022, by 10am. Founded in 2021, the unconventional school is on a mission to transform politics in Africa. In a statement by the Media Director of SPPG, Ozioma Ubabukoh, over the weekend, Ubabukoh stated that the maiden convocation will be held virtually and physically at the Executive Hall of the International Conference Centre, Abuja. “The SPPG is travelling that abandoned road to build a new set of patriots for political leadership,” he stated. The school has inculcated in the graduands the ideological mindset to become leaders and disruptive thinkers, the statement noted. “Having sat under the tutelage of our enriched faculty of over 100 local and international scholars, the graduands have learned that selfless service is required for nation-building. This has been lacking in Nigeria’s politics,” Ozioma said.

Similarly, the Chief Executive Officer of SPPG, Alero Ayida-Otobo, noted that the institution set a goal of raising 10,000 disruptive thinking, values-based political leaders over the next 10 years. The Pioneer Dean of SPPG, Amina Salihu, noted that the character of SPPG, as an unconventional school, lies in its multi-disciplinary curriculum designed to equip its graduates with strong analytical and evidence-based, practical public problem-solving skills. “The school also teaches character, competence, capacity, and what inclusive government should look like,” she added.
