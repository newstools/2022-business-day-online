Its been a fairly strong year for bitcoin as the market price has experienced a tumultuous and volatile movement. It opened the year at $29,207.27 traded on the lows at the middle of the year and as we get to the close of the year, we are trading on the high again which summarizes the volatility of its price range over the year. In more detail as said earlier, Bitcoin opened at $29,207.27 and peaked at $63,569.81 on April 14, 2021. While the number of Covid cases and deaths were at their zenith in May 2021, the average price of BTC was going downhill at a fast pace.

Despite the fact that BTC reached its highest average price in November, market volatility caused it to plummet in December. Between November and December, the average price dropped by approximately 14%, bringing it to $48,088.60. While this drop may be an indicator of the risk aversion that is sweeping financial markets, experts believe that the Omicron strain of the coronavirus, which has harmed other financial sectors, could be the lead factor contributing to this volatility. According to experts, other contributing factors include the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejecting a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which would likely have seen billions poured into the crypto market and China’s clampdown on cryptocurrencies in November.
