You contributed and participated in the Health Mission of our campaign train that transversed all the nooks and crannies of the state, especially the grassroots and riverine communities to offer free medical services to millions of Lagosians, particularly the needy and the downtrodden, who couldn’t afford to pay for such health services. “Since you became the First Lady of Lagos, you have shown passion and commitment to issues relating to health, women and the girl child. And as a women and children advocate, you have been vocal in your campaign against sexual and gender-based violence, especially on issues affecting the younger generations. As the chairman of the Committee of Wives of Lagos State Officials (COWLSO), you have also provided leadership for women to support their husbands in public offices. “Ibijoke, you are a woman I will continue to cherish and love because of your positive impact in my life, our children, our immediate and extended families and Lagos State. You are a good, caring and loving wife, a compassionate and committed mother to our children. ”On this occasion of your 55th birthday, I pray that God will continue to be with you, grant you good health to enable you to render more service to our beloved dear State, the medical profession and humanity.”
