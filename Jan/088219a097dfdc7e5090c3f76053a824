 The Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives said the All Progressives Congress (APC) government should apologise to Nigerians for infringing on their rights and for the huge economic losses recorded as a result of the ban. According to the Caucus, the declaration of a lift on the ban on Twitter amounts to regulatory approval on freedom of speech, which is completely unknown to the country’s laws. The Federal government had in June last year banned Twitter in Nigeria after the platform deleted a post by President Muhamadu Buhari for ‘violation of the company’s abusive behaviour policy’ in renewed Biafran agitations, and lifted the ban earlier this week. But reacting to the new development, the Caucus said the declaration by the APC-led Federal Government of having lifted its unconstitutional ban on use of Twitter in Nigeria as further demonstration of its appetite to suppress constitutionally guaranteed rights of citizens in Nigeria.
