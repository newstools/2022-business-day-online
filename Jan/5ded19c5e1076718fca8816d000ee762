 Wificombat Academy, an edutech space in Nigeria, founded by Dele Tejuoso in partnership with Polyup USA, a silicon edutech company, has led team Nigeria to emerge winner of the Elon Musk Xprice Carbon Removal Project. Eighteen (18) students from both primary and secondary schools across Nigeria engaged in the challenge came out winners in the competition alongside students from 16 other countries organized by Polyup USA. The competition was chaired by the centre for Sustainable Development and global competitiveness (SDGC) at Stanford University and the students provided solutions to earth’s climate change and carbon emission using math, robotics and computational learning. Tejuoso, while speaking about the victory achieved by team Nigeria noted that they were able to reach this height by working in different start-up teams alongside with students from different part of the for six month, counting from July to December, 2021 According to her, three of the start-up teams to which the students belonged emerged the winners which include Samurai Velocity which emerged first position for Carbon removal solution, Golden Ratio which was the second runner-up for Top Libraries Award and Technological Future which came third at the top libraries award.
