 The year 2021 was a roller-coaster year for equities, with eight months of positive returns and four-month of bearish season. The market ended the year 2021 with impressive positive return of 6.7percent amid remarkable last-minute rally which helped push the value of listed stocks up by N1.23trillion in 2021. Interestingly, market liquidity and the record rally were driven majorly by domestic institutional and retail investors, thus reinforcing the potential of Nigerian investors in stabilizing and growing the market. Notwithstanding imminent risks to equity market rally in 2022, Nigerian stocks are still attractive and should remain resilient in this year 2022. The big question now is: what stocks should investors buy in 2022? Stocks seen reoccurring in many analysts BUY lists for 2022 which investors should actively consider in their equities portfolio this year include Dangote Cement Plc, MTN Nigeria Communications Plc, Lafarge Africa Plc, GTCO Plc, Nestle Nigeria, Zenith Bank Plc, BUA Cement, BUA Foods Plc, United Bank for Africa Plc, Fidelity Bank Plc, Access Bank Plc, Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc and Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc. Currently at the Nigerian market, many of these stocks are undervalued and present attractive BUY opportunities for investors seeking both capital appreciation and for long term returns in form of dividend yield. “Companies such as Dangote Cement, MTN Nigeria, GTCO, Nestle and Zenith Bank, which are our top picks, are resilient bellwethers with the history of sustaining earnings growth through political cycles,” according to Isaac Olorungbon, Chief Executive of Deep Trust and Investments Limited. He remains upbeat on the prospect of the Nigerian stock market in 2022, “as our cautious optimism reinforces our outlook of another positive return for Nigerian equity investors in the new year”. Others are: Unilever Nigeria Plc, Okomu Oil Palm Plc, Presco Plc, Vitafoam Plc, Berger Paints Plc, Ardova Plc, SEPLAT Plc and Total Energies Marketing Nigeria Plc. Also on analysts BUY list are Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc, Guinness Nigeria Plc, Conoil Plc, FCMB Group Plc, May & Baker Plc, Fidson Healthcare Plc and Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals Plc. Amid increasing optimism in the market, likely modest rise in the interest rate environment may undermine funds flow to equities in 2022, but positive earnings outlook across most largely capitalised value stocks should reinforce the investment opportunities in those stocks.

Thus, we expect this to somewhat provide a support system for voice revenue through 2022. However, we also bear in mind that voice services are subject to stiff competition, given the growing preference for internet-driven cheaper substitutes. “With the company now underway to getting a PSB licence, product offerings are up for a full-blown scale-up, and we might start to see considerable impact on MTN’s top-line performance,” according to Victoria Ejugwu, Oil & Gas, Telcoms analyst at Lagos-based Vetiva. “Going forward into the 2022 we are guided by our recent Nigerian telecom sector report ‘Delivering a Digital Future’, December 30, in which we recommend a BUY for MTN Nigeria with target price of N266.17/share and a Sell for Airtel Africa with a target price of N793.84/share”, according to Coronation Research analysts in their January 4 note.

However, should the deal materialize, we expect to see an increase in crude output, while we expect cost synergies to result from the integration of administrative operations for the combined entity,” said Luke Ofojebe, Vetiva’s head of research.
