Meanwhile, the commission noted that this extension would enable the Federal Government to consolidate the gains of the process and accelerate the enrolment of Nigerians in key areas like the remote areas, diaspora, schools, hospitals, worship centers, and the registration of legal residents. However, the Minister urged Nigerians and every legal resident to enroll for their NIN and link it to their various SIMs within the extension period as more services will be requiring the number for identification while reiterating the commitment of the FGN to support NCC and NIMC to ensure the aim of the exercise is achieved. Pantami, Umar Garba Danbatta, Executive Vice Chancellor of NCC, Aliyu Azeez, Director General of NIMC on behalf of the FGN expressed gratitude to all Nigerians, stakeholders, and staff for their support towards the success of the exercise while urging them to put more effort to ensure the completion of the enrolment, verification and SIM linkage on or before 31 March 2022.
