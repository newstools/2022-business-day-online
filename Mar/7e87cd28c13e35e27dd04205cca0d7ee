 Elisabeth Borne, the minister for labour, employment and economic inclusion is expected to chair the Council of European Union meeting taking place on Monday, March 14, 2022. The meeting will among other things be discussing the situation in Ukraine and the financial support measures decided on at European level for the reception of refugees. Besides, the meeting hopes to reach a general approach on a proposal for a directive on improving gender balance in the boardroom. Ministers of the member countries will hold an exchange of views on combating discrimination in employment and promoting diversity in the world of work. The EU is seeking to achieve more balanced representation of men and women on the boards of listed companies. While progress towards more equality in this area has been made, it remains slow and uneven across the member states.
