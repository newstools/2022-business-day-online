Presenting the Report before its multi-stakeholders in Abuja, the Executive Secretary of NEITI, Orji Ogbonnaya Orji, stressed that at this time that the government is in a desperate search for revenues to finance the widening budget deficits, NEITI is determined to use its reports to disclose potential revenue recoveries that are awaiting immediate action by the relevant government agencies. “It is of interest to NEITI that every kobo counts to reduce government financial burden, and our reports will continue to provide useful information and data on who owes what in the oil, gas and mining sector. “This is another impact that our reports will pursue in line with our mandate.” Orji said. He announced that the total revenue contributions from the sector in 2020 rose to N128.27billion, an increase of over 54% from the N74.85 billion recorded in 2019 despite the Covid-19 pandemic.
