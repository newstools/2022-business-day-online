We are dissatisfied with the court ruling which is why we have appealed the judgment. “It is about two days ago we started hearing the rumour that a federal high court in Abuja declared our seats vacant on the ground that we defected from PDP to APC.” “I know the position of the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria. But I am not in a position to know how the judiciary interprets the law. I am not against that. “We have filed an appeal and a stay of execution. Since the matter is in the court of law there is no need to say anything about it. Our position is that the law will take its position. We are begging our constituents to remain law-abiding”, Nwifiru appealed.
