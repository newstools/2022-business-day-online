 Investors in Nigeria’s equities market lost about N16billion on Monday driven majorly by notable laggards led by Berger Paints Plc. Market watchers had expected a tepid start to this week’s trading, as investors continue to trade in line with companies’ earnings report released into the market. “Presently, there are no fundamental factors that could spur interest in the market. Moreover, earnings releases and dividend announcements so far this year have done little in triggering investors’ interest. Also, we do not see significant upside on bellwether stocks, leaving little room for bargain hunting,” according to research analysts at Lagos-based Meristem. The analysts, who do not expect the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decision to significantly influence the stock market, noted that barring upward movement in any large cap stock, “we expect the market to close negative this week.” Read also: Investors lose N6bn as equities fail to sustain gain Berger Paints led the laggards on Monday after its share price decreased from N8.30 to N7.50, down by 80 kobo or 9.64percent, followed by Ikeja Hotel which decreased from N1.37 to N1.25, losing 12kobo or 8.76percent.
