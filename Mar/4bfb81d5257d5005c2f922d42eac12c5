 Atiku Abubakar, former vice president of Nigeria has declared his intention to contest for the 2023 Presidential election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Atiku made his declaration Wednesday at the International Conference Centre in Abuja, disclosing that he was in the race to rescue Nigeria which has become a sinking ship. He said the 2023 general election is not just usual polls but a referendum when Nigerians will decide whether “we want greatness or continuous destruction. It is a choice between two paths, the power of unity and progress, or the power of division and backwardness. We need a new kind of leadership.” Read also: 2023: Joseph Yobo joins politics, floats political group Atiku said his presidency would focus on five key areas which are; unity of Nigeria, security, economy, education and devolution of more powers to the federating units. “Since the Civil War Unity of Nigeria has never been threatened as it is today.

The most significant human right is the right to life, which has not been protected under the current APC administration. Our military forces are fighting on the front lines, without the equipment and morale,” Atiku said.
