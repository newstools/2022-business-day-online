We will meet our political, traditional, religious, and business leaders. We will meet the traders, schoolboys, girls, taxi drivers,” Yobo said. For now it is unclear how the former Everton captain plans to combine his duties as one of the assistants to Super Eagles head coach Augustine Eguavoen and his functions at the GMI. Yobo was named into the national team’s coaching crew in 2020 following a distinguished career that saw him feature for Standard Liege, Marseille, Everton, Fenerbahce, and Norwich City.
