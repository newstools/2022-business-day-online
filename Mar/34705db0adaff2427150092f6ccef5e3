According to Danbatta, many countries are exploring policies to stimulate growth and create and create new jobs due to the COVID-19-induced economic downturn and continued volatility. “Information Communications Technology (ICT) is one of the fastest-growing industries because it triggers the creation of millions of jobs and therefore an enabler of innovation and socio-economic development”, Danbatta stated.
