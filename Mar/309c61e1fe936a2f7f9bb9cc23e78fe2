 It is well known that fintech companies are using technology to provide easier ways for customers and clients to manage their finances. However, while some might say they are doing this better than commercial banks, there is nothing to suggest that the commercial banks are losing out. From 1892, when the first commercial bank was established in Lagos, the banking business in Africa’s largest economy has evolved to a point where customers can now complete transactions at the comfort of their homes. Considering the monetary stance of the apex bank to keep interest rates low in order to encourage borrowings and stimulate the economy from the covid-19 induced recession in the previous year, Nigeria’s commercial banks are taking advantage of electronic banking to ramp up efforts to boost revenue from other generating units. These banks are benefitting massively from the wave of mobile phone adoption proving easy-to-use banking apps that are secure and operate seemingly like social media apps. In a usual fashion, BusinessDay presents the top-earning banks from their various e-business units. The list was dominated by the five tier-one banks in the country, commonly referred to as FUGAZ.

Challenges from FinTech Lamin Manjang, CEO of Standard Chartered Bank Nigeria, says through the recent impact of technology and financial literacy, the word ‘Bank’ now connotes different reactions to different people. “Personalised financial growth, opportunities for business collaborations, access to foreign investment opportunities, transferable generational wealth, and financial security all on one’s terms are some of the prevailing thoughts for customers,” he states. Despite commercial bank’s income, Fintech companies like Paystack, PiggyVest, Kuda Bank and others are innovating past traditional institutions by making digital financial services like lending, savings, or investing readily available to people. They have been able to recognize the pain points for users, which have not been addressed by commercial banks. Also, other fintech startups have fuelled the growth of alternative lenders which offer both higher yields to investors and faster, cheaper, more convenient loans for borrowers compared to traditional banks. Startups like Carbon and Branch offer lower loan rates than commercial banks and this is mostly because fintech companies are not subject to the operational costs involved in running a traditional bank with multiple branches.
