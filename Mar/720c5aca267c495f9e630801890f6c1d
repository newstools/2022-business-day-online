 The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has stated that Issuers would henceforth be required to obtain the reference letter of “No-Objection” from their respective primary regulators and file same along with other application documents presented to the Commission. This was contained in a Circular issued by the Commission, Thursday. The SEC states that this has become necessary in a bid to further improve the Commission’s transaction turn-around period and enhance the integrity of capital market instruments. According to the Circular, “the Commission hereby draws the attention of Issuing Houses to the due diligence requirement for a “No-Objection” letter from “primary regulators” of Issuers, especially those in the Banking and Insurance sectors, as a prerequisite for the Commission’s approval of proposed transactions”.
